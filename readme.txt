FORTUNA SWEEPER
FortunaSweeper is a basic minesweeper application that features a 9x9 grid with 10 mines.
To win the game, one must reveal all of the tiles on the board without detonating any mines.
A numbered tile indicates how many neighbouring tiles contain mines, where a neighbouring tile includes diagonals.
When in flag mode, you can place flags where you think bombs are, instead of uncovering a tile.
The number of flags is shown on the right, and corresponds to the number of bombs in the grid.

CONTROLS
To move your cursor, use the directional buttons.
To uncover a tile, press the centre button.
To switch between uncover and flag mode, turn the rotary encoder.
